# Compiler

## Python


## Data types
- integer
- float
- boolean

</br>

## Declarations

```python
integer = 2

float = 3.4

bool = True

# No Arrays
# No string
```

## Operators

|Operator|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|`+`|addition|
|`-`|subtraction|
|`*`|multiplication|
|`/`|quotient|
|`%`|remainder|

### Comparison
|Operator|Description|

|`==`|equal|
|`!=`|not equal|
|`<`|less than|
|`<=`|less than or equal|
|`>`|greater than|
|`>=`|greater than or equal|

## if-else

```python
if condition1:
   ...
elif condition2:
   ...
else:
   ...

// Example:
if 3 in [1, 2, 3]:
  println "Exists"

# Array and strings are not
# implemented, btw

```




## Functions
```python
# Incomplete implementation
```


# Compiler Implementation
- First the python file is converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree, using python's ast module.
- This astree is recursively broken down using two functions: 
  - Compile: Looks at the code and tries to generate the assembly code
  - evaluate: If there is an expression (binary operation,boolean operation, comparison), then that expression is given to the evaluate function to recursively evaluate it and generate the assembly code.
- This style of compilation is inspired from LISP programming language.
- Memory usage: So, this compiler uses 32Kb of program memory, 4kb of temporary memory, and all registers and float single precision registers
  - 0x20000000 to 0x20007FFF is program memory where variables are allocated
  - 0xE0000000 to 0xE0000FFF is 4kb temporary memory, used for internal operations. These memory locations are allocated and freed from time to time.
  - Similarly all registers are allocated and freed from time to time

## Int and float compatibility
- This compiler is able to achieve compatibility between these types
- It means that any operation can be performed on these types without explicitly converting them
- Ex:
```python
x = 10.1
y = 1
z = x+y #This works even if x and y are of different types
```
- Similarly all arithmetic and logical operations can be performed on these types without any problem.

# Input and Output
- The Input would be a .py file, which would contain the python code you would want to compile
```bash
python compiler.py > assembly_file_name.s
Enter file name :<enter your file name here>
```
- Then the output would appear in the assembly_file_name.s file which you can directly use in keil to assemble it.

### Sample Input:
```python
x = 10.11
y = 90
y = x*y
```

### Output:
```arm
  area appcode, CODE, READONLY
  export __main
  ENTRY
__main function
